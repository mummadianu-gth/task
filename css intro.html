<!-- CSS Introduction
-----------------------
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements — controlling colors, layouts, fonts, spacing, and more.
It separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), making web pages cleaner and easier to maintain. -->


<!-- Responsive Web Design (RWD)
RWD means making websites look good on all devices — desktops, tablets, and mobiles — by adapting layouts.
Key features:

Fluid layouts (use % or vw/vh instead of fixed px)

Media queries to change style based on screen width

Flexible images (max-width: 100%; height: auto;) -->


<!-- Ways to Insert CSS in HTML
There are three main ways:
1. Inline CSS
Applied directly to an element’s style attribute.
Best for quick changes, not for large projects.

2. Internal CSS
Written inside <style> tags in the <head> section of the HTML file.
Useful for styling a single page.

3. External CSS
Written in a separate .css file and linked using <link> in the HTML.
Best for large projects and reusing styles across multiple pages. -->
